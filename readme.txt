NF_DLOAD

A script for automating the download and installation of nerd fonts.

If you want the full set of nerd fonts, but are having trouble cloning the repo or just
don't want to manualy download each font, this script can help you.

As of right now it is setup to work with Linux systems. I do plan on adding Windows and Mac support.

Right now is gets the download links from nerd fonts website, but I do
plan on pointing it to the github repo in the future to help stay current incase
they do not update the links on the website.
